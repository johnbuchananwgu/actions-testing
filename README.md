# actions-testing

Current test: Added simple Knock knock to the GitHub Action. I think I had updated the actions yml file on the master branch rather than the development branch. Both should have the same new echo in them and hopefully we can't get merge conflicts when I run the next test of seeing this through a pull request/merge.

First test: Simple pull request to review the github action Jake and I were experimenting with before.
