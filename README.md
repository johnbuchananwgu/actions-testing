# actions-testing

These are the changes I'm messing with, newest on top.

- Pull to master

- Added simple Knock knock to the GitHub Action. I think I had updated the actions yml file on the master branch rather than the development branch. Both should have the same new echo in them and hopefully we can't get merge conflicts when I run the next test of seeing this through a pull request/merge.



- Simple pull request to review the github action Jake and I were experimenting with before.
